# Introduction

Art Deco is an old design style. It is not preferred much in today’s era, but the new, modern version of it is quite eye-catching. We can pick certain elements to incorporate into our designs.

Initially, the Art Deco style emerged in the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by its luxurious and glamorous aesthetic. It’s known for bold geometric shapes, vivid colors, and streamlined forms. This style is all about **making a big statement** in interior decorating and architecture.

Let’s look at some key features of the Art Deco design style.

## Geometric shapes

Art Deco often incorporates bold geometric shapes and patterns in its designs, such as:

- zigzags  
- triangles  
- trapezoidal shapes  
- sweeping curves  
- stepped forms  
- circles  

These shapes can be found in furniture, lighting, and decorative elements.

## Luxurious materials

Art Deco is associated with **luxury and opulence**, often featuring materials such as marble, brass, mirror, glass, lacquer, and chrome.  
For upholstery, rich fabrics like **velvet** are favored.

## Rich colors

Art Deco embraces vibrant colors like **gold, silver, black, and white**, as well as jewel tones such as **emerald green, sapphire blue, and ruby red**.

Softer colors like **cream and beige** can also be used. Neutral tones paired with polished wood are a strong combination in this style.

## Furniture

Art Deco furniture is **sleek and streamlined**, with smooth, curved lines and minimal ornamentation.
